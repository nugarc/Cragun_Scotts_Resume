# Cragun Scott's Resume Repo

Hello all. This repository is dedicated to keeping track of my resume. As you may know, a resume can change, be updated, and custimized for a particular job. Sence file management can be a pain, I have desided to use this repo to keep track of all of that for me.

I am keeping this repo very simple. My current resume, which will have all of my experience and skill information will be in the same directory as this readme file. I will also keep any current job specific resumes here too. When I am finished with a job specific resume, I will move it to the old resume directory. I will make a new commit everytime I update my everthing resume. This means that previous versions of my resume will be availabe for others to view in the repo's commit history. 

The main file type I will be using is a .tex file. This will allow me to easily change and custimize my resume to fit my needs. This also means that the file size wont be too big. I used to use .docx files though. I uploaded these and they can be found in the commit history. The latest .docx file version is also located in the Old resume directory.

It is my hope that this repository will help make my resume more accessable to me, potential employers, my colleagues, and others.
